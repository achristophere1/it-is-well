            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                   I am putting together a web layout for individuals who have experienced emptieness on their pursuit<br>
                    to a successful life. There are many individuals that felt their lives were predicted to fail because<br>
                    of the lack of ambition in the early educational stages of life. What I hope to provide for<br>
                    the users are some key factors that they can think about when trying to find purpose, opportunity, and passion.<br>
                    In this outline I am highlighting stages of my life that a high percentage of the average failures<br>
                    can relate to. Then I began to give tips of how to exit that failure trajectory and awaken new paths<br>
                    to success.
